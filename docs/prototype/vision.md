# Vision & Success Criteria

## Prototype Goal
Deliver a 15-minute match vertical slice that validates the cat-and-mouse tension between a single Dark Lord and two distinct heroes (Exiled Knight and Goblin Outlaw) across a procedurally assembled map. The prototype must demonstrate the core asymmetric RTS fantasy with touch-friendly controls.

## Success Metrics
- **Engagement:** 70% of internal playtesters voluntarily request a second match within the same session.
- **Match Flow:** Average match duration stays between 13â€“17 minutes with observable early, mid, and late-game beats.
- **Asymmetry Validation:** Playtest feedback indicates both heroes feel meaningfully different while the Dark Lord can exert pressure without direct control.
- **Technical Stability:** 95% of sessions complete without desynchronization or game-breaking bugs on target mid-tier mobile hardware.
- **Performance:** Frame rate remains at or above 30 FPS on reference Android (Snapdragon 765) and iOS (A12) devices during large skirmishes.

## Scope Guardrails
- Limit hero roster to the Exiled Knight and Goblin Outlaw; the Forest Witch is reserved for a later iteration.
- Restrict castle defenses to one breakable gate, one tower type, and one ritual node to accelerate content creation.
- Author three biome chunks (village, shrine, forest) that can be recombined to simulate procedural variety without overproducing art.
- Deliver only stub matchmaking and monetization flows; focus on the gameplay loop and telemetry capture.
