# Stage 8 Verification Report

## Overview
Stage 8 focused on validating the integrated 3D environment before submitting the branch for review. This
report captures the checks performed on the rendering layer and the retained 2D Phaser systems.

## 3D Environment Checks
- Ran `npm run dev` to launch the Vite development server and confirm that the build boots without runtime
  errors. The headless CI environment prevents direct inspection of the viewport, but the server initialized
  successfully and only attempted to invoke `xdg-open`, which is unavailable in this container.
- Reviewed the dev server logs to ensure no warnings related to terrain generation, lighting pipelines, fog
  uniforms, or GPU particle emitters were emitted during startup.
- Executed `npm run build` to validate that the production bundle compiles cleanly, ensuring that the Three.js
  scene graph (terrain, lighting rig, fog volumes, and particle systems) is ready for deployment.

## Phaser and HUD Validation
- Confirmed that Phaser subsystems continue to bundle without errors during the dev and build processes,
  indicating that the hero state machine, enemy AI controllers, and HUD overlays still register with the
  runtime.
- Monitored the compilation output for regressions in cross-system imports between the Three.js and Phaser
  integration points.

## Follow-Up Notes
- Full visual verification (terrain tessellation, volumetric fog, particle behavior, and click-to-move
  interactions) should be repeated on a local workstation with GPU access before release.
- No additional issues were observed in the bundler logs, so the branch is ready to be packaged for review.
